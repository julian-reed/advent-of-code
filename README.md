This repo tracks my progress in Advent of Code. I figured I might as well do it since I'm on break, and hopefully I'll learn something new or sharpen up old skills as I go through the problems.

My work on AOC for this year is now complete. For why I didn't get all starts for days 9, 10 and 12, see the comment at the top of each solution file. Overall, these were a fun set of problems and I sharpened up on a lot of techniques I haven't used in a while, so this was a worthwhile experience. Looking forward to next year!
